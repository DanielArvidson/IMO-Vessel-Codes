Description of Data

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) number is a unique reference for ships and for registered ship owners and management companies. IMO numbers were introduced under the SOLAS Convention to improve maritime safety and security and to reduce maritime fraud. For ships, the IMO number remains linked to the hull for its lifetime, regardless of a change in name, flag, or owner.

For electronic messages the data that is required for transmission is:
* IMO Code
* Vessel Name
* Vessel Flag

To categorise the vessel, the following is also included:
* Vessel Type (Cargo, Tanker, fishing etc)

The data set could be expanded to include other items, but they must be relevant to the specific vessel/IMO only to be useful.
